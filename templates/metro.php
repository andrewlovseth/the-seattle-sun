                    <p>Thick smoke blanketed much of the Pacific Northwest on Monday as numerous wildfires in Canada, Washington and Oregon continued to burn, killing at least one person, destroying scores of buildings and threatening dozens more.</p>
                    
                    <p>At least six large fires were burning in Washington State, including the Gray Fire, which was discovered around noon on Friday and was only 10 percent contained as of Monday morning, and the Oregon Road fire, which had burned more than 10,000 acres and was also only 10 percent contained, according to a state fire tracking agency. In Oregon, another four large fires were burning, three of which were just outside of Eugene.</p>

                    <p>The Washington State Department of Natural Resources said at least one person had died in the Gray fire and another death in connection with the Oregon Road fire was under investigation, but that the cause had not been determined. At least 265 structures were destroyed by the Gray and Oregon Road fires.</p>

                    <p>As the sun rose in Seattle, the Space Needle’s web camera captured a city under a gray, purplish haze. The Air Quality Index, which measures the density of major pollutants in the air, reached 178 as an air quality alert remained in place through Monday afternoon. The air in Issaquah, about 17 miles east of Seattle, registered 182. An index number above 200 is considered “very unhealthy.”</p>

                    <p>But by Monday afternoon, air quality was beginning to improve thanks to an onshore flow that was pushing smoke out of the area. The Air Quality Index measured 95, a moderate risk level, and the quality was expected to continue to improve through the evening and into tomorrow morning, Maddie Kristell, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Seattle, said.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ms. Kristell said the smoky air was the result of an accumulation of multiple fires in the area, including the Gray, the Oregon Road and the Sourdough fire, another fire about 125 miles northeast of Seattle.</p>
                    
                    <p>“We’ve gotten a little bit of everybody’s smoke,” she said.</p>
